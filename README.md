# wpacrack

wpacrack is a bash project I completed during my junior year of college at Penn State Univesity. This was project I began one day for fun after reading [this](https://louisabraham.github.io/articles/WPA-wifi-cracking-MBP.html) blog post. I chose this project to work on my bash scripting. As I continue to learn C/C++ I would like to implement the attack this script carries out entirely from scratch.
